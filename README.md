# Server-programming-project Election machine

We have done this same project twice. During the first time we didn't use JPA in it. During the second time we used JPA([You can go to watch the repository of that project here](https://github.com/JenniLehtonen/Server-programming-jpa)).


This project was a school project that was done in a team of 4 members.
In this project we programmed an election machine (“vaalikone” in Finnish), where the user can answer the questions and compare their answers to the candidates’ answers. The user can also search candidates by their party and see more information of them.

The administrator can log in and add, edit, and remove candidates and questions. In addition, the admin is able to add and edit candidates’ answers to the questions.

We got the data of the candidates and their answers from our school.
During this project we used **scrum** to manage the tasks: we had our product backlog, sprint backlogs, sprint planning meetings, sprint reviews and daily scrum meetings. We didn't have enough time to finish this project entirely so the UI isn't ready but otherwise the application works well.
